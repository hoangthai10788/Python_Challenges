# Python_Challenges

## PyElections

In this challenge, you are tasked with helping the city of Houston modernize its vote-counting process for the next mayoral elections. No candidate won a majority (over 50%) of the vote during the general election that took place on November 5, 2019. The 2019 Houston mayoral election was decided by a runoff on December 14, 2019 to elect the Mayor of Space City. 
However, your job is to only write a script that will decide the two candidates with the highest number of votes who will advance to the runoff election. Houstonians are counting on you!


You will be given a set of the last general election data called houston_election_data.csv. The dataset is composed of three columns: Candidate, County, and Voter ID. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:


The total number of votes cast


A complete list of candidates who received votes


The percentage of votes each candidate won


The total number of votes each candidate won


Print the names of the two candidates who will advance to the runoff election.


## PyFinances

In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Profit/Losses and Date. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)


Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:


The total number of months included in the dataset


The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period


The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
